# # I am your next Graphic Designer

I am 24 years old and I am a web & graphic designer based in the 6 (13), with over 3 years of freelance and studio experience. Design and Art have been in my life since I was a twinkle in my mothers eye. 

I have always loved anything related with pixels, graphics and **eye catching** design. Now in my final year of the Algonquin College Graphic Design Program I have learned that I have a passion for designing detailed, creative and modern design. I am ready and excited to see where my future in design takes me.a
